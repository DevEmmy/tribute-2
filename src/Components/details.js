    bio: `Pa. Eric Ehiorobu Udele was born to the family of late Mr. Ukpoma Udele in Idumu-Ugbonta, Ake, Igbanke, Orhionmwon Local Government Area, Edo State. He was the 4th child out of 6 children that his mother gave birth to.
    He attended Anglican School where he obtained his Grade A primary school leaving certificate in 1963 in the then Mid-Western Nigeria.
    In 1964, he moved to Sapele, Delta State after obtaining his primary school education. Always striving for the best in life, he later moved to Lagos in 1965 where he took employment with UAC and Continental African Production Limited (CAP) 
    A pivotal point in his life was when he dedicated his life to Jehovah God and got baptized In 1971, at a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ilesha. He brought the truth to his family and some among his family and in-laws learnt the good news from him and are now servants of Jehovah.
    He got married to sister Romina Osazuwa in October 1976. The marriage was blessed with loads of love and 6 beautiful children.
    He worked with the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) now Bank of Industry (BOI) until 1995.
    He also worked for some years with Ashaka Security Co. until his retirement.
    He was kind, loving, generous, friendly and approachable Father, Grand Father, Brother, Uncle and Friend. Respected and loved by not just his children, but by many in the Christian congregation for his zeal for the ministry and for his love for his fellow brothers and sisters. He was respected in the community for his peace loving disposition and efforts to teach any who would listen the truth about Jehovah God.
    His love for Jehovah was evident in the way he cared for his family, raising his children spiritually in the way of Jehovah. His darling wife passed away in 1998. Bro. Eric continued to show trust in Jehovah, even encouraging others by the fine way he handled his responsibility in the Christian Congregation and as a single parent. At a time in his life, he had the privilege to serve as an overseer in the Christian congregation, a responsibility he faithfully handled for many years.
    Bro. Eric was a zealous evangelizer of the good news. He served Jehovah faithfully in various capacity until his old age and eventually his death. He passed away peacefully in his bed on Monday, September 12, 2022. 
    We are comforted in the reassuring hope of the resurrection Act 24:15
    More on his life on earth will be updated upon his resurrection. Stay tuned.`,

        tribute: `"Papa, thank you for inculcating Jehovah’s word in us from infancy, you gave us the best of you. Thank you for your courage, wisdom, dedication, laughter, kindness, love, commitment and for leaving the world better than you found it. 
        My Papa knew what it meant to be called a father, to him it wasn’t just a biological title. My Papa is our patriarch, a leader, an exemplar, a confidant, a teacher, a hero and a friend.
        My Papa was my North, my South, my East and West, my working week, my talk, my song, and my dance partner.
        Papa, my mind still talks to you, my heart looks for you. I will miss you so much; all your proverbs, jokes, facial expressions, stern warnings, advise and smile, but I will never forget you. But I am comforted that you are now at peace. I will open up my heart and everyone I love will know exactly who you are because this is not goodbye, it is just till we meet again. Looking forward to seeing you in the new world.
        I love you, Papa."`,

        tribute: `"My late friend brother Eric Udele proved to be my best friend among brothers. We knew each other in 1971. In 1974 we went in search for a wife for him due to inexperience. We committed laughable blunder. When we got to the first sister I told her that brother want to marry you, do you agree or not? And she said no. Therefore, we went to another sister and used the same approach. But she told us she will think about it. We left her and concluded that she was not interested. Then he went home and got his late wife. Later, the two sisters we wrongly approached came accusing me of denying them of their husband. I was his best man during his wedding. We have remained friends ever since. I have ever green memory of him. Our love for each other affected our families. His love for his children prevented him from remarrying despite preasure from women fold. He visited my family here in Imo state in 1995. Since he left for his home, I have not visited Lagos due to no place to lay my head. Everytime I visited him was a moment of refreshment for all of us. What a friend. May Jehovah remember him during ressurection."`,

        tribute: `"TRIBUTE TO MY DEAREST DAD
        Today I am remembering my dad and the great memories that we shared.
        My dad was an incredible man. He provided for his family and made his children had the guidance they needed. He made parenting looked so easy, playing a dual role; being a father and a mother to his children, choosing your kids after our mom's death, to give us your best.
        The best gift he gave to us is making us to know about Jehovah. Papa is a very GENEROUS man. Everyone belongs to him, always having a listening ear to people. He was one of a kind. He jokes a lot and made us all laugh.
        I never questioned if you loved or care for me, because you made it so obvious.
        You played a major role in developing my perspectives. We discussed everything. You take special interest in my school grades and you took pride in my success. You taught me how to go about my first "period without shame, how to make use of sanitary towel. 
        Will this tears stop? No! There will be days when the tears will pour and days when I will just smile and think of the legacy you left behind. As my grief passes, your memories will forever remain. 
        Thank you for making me to know about Jehovah and the wonderful promise and hope that when the dead are resurrected, I will see you again and you will be reunited  with our mom.
        You will greatly be missed. Love you dad."`,
